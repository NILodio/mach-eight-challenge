# mach-eight-challenge
==============================

The project is to write a function that searches through NBA player heights based on user input. The raw data is taken from [https://www.openintro.org/data/index.php?data=nba_heights)](https://www.openintro.org/data/index.php?data=nba_heights).  The data is served in json format by the endpoint [https://mach-eight.uc.r.appspot.com/)](https://mach-eight.uc.r.appspot.com/).

The task is to create an application that takes a single integer input. The application will download the raw data from the website above [https://mach-eight.uc.r.appspot.com)](https://mach-eight.uc.r.appspot.com) and print a list of all pairs of players whose height in inches adds up to the integer input to the application. If no matches are found, the application will print `No matches found`


#### Sample output is as follows:
```
> app 139

- Brevin Knight         Nate Robinson
- Nate Robinson         Mike Wilks
```

The algorithm to find the pairs must be faster than `O(n^2)`. All edge cases
should be handled appropriately. This is _not_ a closed book test. You are
encouraged to reach out with any questions that you come across.

#### Evaluation

All candidates who submit an algorithm that is efficient and correct will pass
to the next step of the interview process. We define "efficient" as faster than
O(n^2) and "correct" as returning the correct results for all possible inputs.
Any assignment that doesn't return the correct answer for the sample input
above (139) will fail.

## Solution

### Algorithm 

This problem can be solved efficiently by using the technique of hashing. Use a hash_map to check for the current array value x(let), if there exists a value target_sum-x which on adding to the former gives target_sum. This can be done in constant time. Letâ€™s look at the algorithm in [`modelling/app.py`](https://github.com/NILodio/mach-eight-challenge/blob/master/modelling/app.py)

#### Complexity Analysis:

- Time Complexity: O(n).

As the whole array is needed to be traversed only once.

- Auxiliary Space: O(n).

A hash map has been used to store array elements.
